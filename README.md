# PyBer-Analysis

## Project Overview
The goal of this project was to visualize rideshare fare data by city types: 'Urban', 'Suburban', 'Rural'.

## Resources
- Data Source: city_data.csv , ride_data.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Jupyter Notebook

## Results
The analysis of the ridesharing data shows that:
- From most expensive to least expensive the city types rank as such: Urban, Suburban, Rural
  - This does not change over the entire extent of the time measured, 1/1/19 - 4/29/19

- Shown below are the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, average fare per driver, and total fare, all broken down by city type

- Urban areas have the most total rides, total drivers, and total fares, but have the lowest average fare per ride and lowest average fare per driver
- Suburban areas are in the middle in every category but skew closer to rural areas than urban
- Rural areas have the fewest total rides, total drivers, and total fares, but have the highest average fare per ride and highest average fare per driver.

## Summary
Based on the results, we can conclude that there is a lower volume of customers for rideshare services in rural areas, and an even lower proportion of drivers to service them. Which is what causes average fares to be so much higher in rural areas.
